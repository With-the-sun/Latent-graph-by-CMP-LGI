# Latent graph by CMP-LGI
The latent graph obtained after multiple discrete sampling based on the edge probability set learned by CMP-LGI.
Pyvis is a good visual graph structure tool (https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). In the application case of the CMP-LGI algorithm, pyvis is used to visualize the graph structure obtained by discrete sampling. Please use a browser to open 'CMP-LGI_black.html', such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc. The nodes in the graph correspond to the indicators in 'https://github.com/With-the-sun/PN-CRAR-mode-s-casedata.git '
